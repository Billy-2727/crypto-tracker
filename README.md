# Crypto Tracker

This project is built with React, ChartJS & Bootstrap

Building this project allowed me to get an understaning of how to fetch data from APIs using axios as well as how to display the data in a readable format.

It uses bootstrap for the UI elements I used Bootstrap as it gave me the oppertunity to easily display a readable & understandable UI.

The charts on each of the coin detail pages are made using ChartJS.

In this project I broadend my knowledge of how to use React, how to use ChartJS within React and I also learned how to call on APIs using axios.
